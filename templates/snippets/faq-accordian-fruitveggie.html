					<p>We are unable to guarantee todayâ€™s pricing beyond today. Our pricing often changes due to the constantly changing prices of the high-quality, made-in-the-USA ingredients. Also, the recent attempt by FEMA and DHS to hoard survival food may result in decreased supply throughout the market. To guarantee our lowest pricing, be sure to secure your order today.</p>
