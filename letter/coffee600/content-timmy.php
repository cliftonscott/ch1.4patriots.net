	<p>Dear Patriot,</p>
	<p><strong><em>I&rsquo;m going to go out on a limb here and guess something about you right now.</em></strong></p>
	<p>I bet you&rsquo;re a fantastic planner, ready for anything and everything that might come your way.</p>
	<p>You may even have a supply stockpile: backup staples like food, candles, batteries, and a clean source of water.</p>
	<img class="img-responsive pull-right img-padding-left" src="/media/images/f4p/letter/f4p-coffee600-03.jpg" alt="Coffee bags">
	<p><strong><em>But I can also predict that you&rsquo;re missing one vital thing that&rsquo;s far more important than you might think at first glance, and that&rsquo;s&hellip;</em></strong></p>
	<p><strong>Coffee. </strong></p>
	<p>Let me tell you why.</p>
	<p>For one thing, you&rsquo;re certainly not the only one who loves a cup of coffee first thing in the morning to get them going.</p>
	<p>Me? I&rsquo;m one of those people who would rather you didn&rsquo;t even LOOK in my direction before I hit the coffee pot.</p>
	<p><em>And I&rsquo;m not alone.</em></p>
	<p>There are approximately 150 million other folks who line up at Starbucks and Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts each day like soldiers to get their morning fix.</p>
	<p>Not to mention&hellip; the 2 p.m. &ldquo;pick me up&rdquo; to get through the afternoon! My local coffee joint has got a line wrapped around it all day long!</p>
	<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing&hellip; if a food shortage or natural disaster does occur, <strong>coffee might just save your life</strong>, especially if you&rsquo;re the only one who has any.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Because in a crisis, you can bet your hind end that coffee will fly off the shelves as fast or faster than any other stockpile supply.</p>
	<p>And I guarantee that it&rsquo;ll be gone in well under 72 hours.</p>

	<h2 class="darkRed text-center">Drinking A Cup Of Coffee Might Very Well Be The Thing That Keeps You Safe (And Sane)<br class="hidden-xs"> In A Crisis.</h2>
	<img class="img-responsive pull-right img-padding-left" src="/media/images/f4p/letter/f4p-coffee600-01.jpg" alt="Coffee bags">
	<p>And even if getting that little boost wasn&rsquo;t enough&hellip;</p>
	<p>There are a ton of health benefits to drinking coffee regularly, but there are some other not so commonly known benefits to having coffee on hand too, like:</p>
	<ul class="fa-ul fa-ul-space">
		<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i><strong>Boost your clarity and concentration: </strong>&ldquo;Calming stimulant&rdquo; may seem like an oxymoron, but the proof is clear. A cup of coffee in a stressful situation has a calming and clarifying effect on many people.</li>
		<p>Believe it or not, even the SMELL of coffee can bring peace and harmony back in a stressful situation… it’s a subliminal sensory reaction! </p>
		<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i><strong>Improve taste of your water:</strong> If you&rsquo;re stuck in a crisis filtering water from a &ldquo;survival source,&rdquo; it might be clean and pure&hellip; but it still might taste like dirt.</li>
		<p>Rather than drinking terrible tasting water, make a cup of coffee and it’ll go down better… the boiling helps to purify it, and the bold flavor will mask any remaining unpleasant odor!</p>
		<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i><strong>Use coffee as currency:</strong> Even if you don&rsquo;t plan to drink the coffee yourself, it&rsquo;s incredibly easy to use as a form of currency in an emergency. In fact, coffee is historically one of the most desired items in an uncertain time, going all the way back to 13<sup>th</sup> century Yemen!</li>
		<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i><strong>Take your performance to the next level: </strong> A powerful antioxidant, coffee boosts metabolism, reduces cholesterol levels, and can even ease depression (a powerful benefit indeed if you&rsquo;re in a crisis situation!).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It&rsquo;s crystal clear: <strong>You absolutely MUST have a supply of coffee in your survival stockpile.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>And going to Costco just isn&rsquo;t going to cut it. It goes bad faster than you might think! You need a supply of coffee that&rsquo;s guaranteed to stand up to the test of time, and taste great from the first cup to the last.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Trust me, you don&rsquo;t want to be caught in a situation where the grocery stores are all shuttered and you don&rsquo;t have a clue when things might return to &ldquo;normal.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve put together the <strong>Food4Patriots Survival Coffee Kit&hellip;</strong></p>

	<h2 class="darkRed text-center"> Guaranteed Shelf Life Of 25 Years, And Delicious From The First Taste<br class="hidden-xs"> To The Last Drop...</h2>
	<p>Your survival coffee kit comes with some of the best coffee on the planet&hellip;</p>
	<p>It&rsquo;s 100% pure Colombian coffee, 100% Non-GMO and 100% Arabica, straight from the tree to the roaster, to the freeze dryer, and into your cup. (Compare that to a $5.00 latte from your local Starbucks!)</p>
	<p>Plus&hellip; it tastes GREAT! Our super fast processing keeps this coffee incredibly fresh and robust&hellip; and we&rsquo;ll guarantee it for the next 25 full years.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>And, I&rsquo;m 100% sure you&rsquo;re going to LOVE it.</p>
	<p>What if coffee&rsquo;s just not for you?</p>

	<h2 class="darkRed text-center">Hey Frank… I’m NOT A Coffee Drinker.<br class="hidden-xs"> What’s In It For Me?</h2>
	<p>Well, ain&rsquo;t that something.</p>
	<p>Alright, maybe you are one of the few people in the world who don&rsquo;t wake up every single morning craving (or demanding!) a fresh cuppa Joe.</p>
	<p><strong>That may put you in the very best position of all&hellip; </strong></p>
	<p>Why?</p>
	<p>If you find yourself in a crisis situation, <strong>coffee is one of the best possible things to be in possession of,</strong> to use for barter or trade for other necessities that you may not have access to.</p>
	<p>Even if you&rsquo;re not going to drink it yourself, people will line up outside your door like you&rsquo;ve become their personal barista&hellip; because so many people just can&rsquo;t function without their daily dose.&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong><em>So, you might be thinking, &ldquo;well Frank, can&rsquo;t I just use cash?&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
	<p>Sure&hellip; you could&hellip; theoretically.</p>
	<p><strong>But relying solely on cash could land you and your family in hot water.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>A crisis situation can play out a lot like a no-limit game of Texas Hold &lsquo;Em (that&rsquo;s poker to me and you), and winning can mean the difference between life and death.</p>
	<p>The stakes are high.</p>
	<p><strong><em>You might not want to show your whole hand, and keeping a poker face is instrumental to your survival.</em></strong></p>
	<p>If you have cash on hand, do you really want others to know you do?</p>
	<p>Plus, if things get bad enough for banks to shut down, your money may not be worth the paper it&rsquo;s printed on&hellip;</p>
	<p>But you can run the table if you have a good stockpile of coffee on hand.&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong><em>It&rsquo;s the difference between holding two pairs of aces&hellip; or a pair of twos.</em></strong></p>
	<p>And in contrast to cash, if you&rsquo;re bartering coffee you have the upper hand, and you get to decide &ldquo;how much&rdquo; it&rsquo;s worth in exchange.</p>
	<p>You just might be surprised at how much value others will place on it.</p>
	<p>And that, friends, is how you turn a cup of coffee into a pot of gold.</p>
	<p>So&hellip; what&rsquo;s in the box? Happy to tell you:</p>

	<h2 class="darkRed text-center">Here's Exactly What You'll Get When You Get Your Food4patriots Survival Coffee Kit:</h2>
	<img class="img-responsive center-block margin-tb-20" style="width: 100%" src="/media/images/f4p/f4p-coffee600-kit-tote-03.jpg" alt="">

	<h2 class="darkRed text-center">Rated for 25-Years But Tastes “Fresh Roasted,” Like It Was Ground By A Barista<br class="hidden-xs"> Just Seconds Ago.</h2>
	<p>So imagine this for me&hellip;</p>
	<p>You&rsquo;re hunkered in a bunker, waiting out a crisis.</p>
	<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people in there. Anxious, tired, wired&hellip; with guns and ammo at their disposal.</p>
	<p>And some of &lsquo;em with itchy trigger fingers.</p>
	<p>Tensions are high and the mood is gloomy.</p>
	<p>But then, you put on some water and whip out a packet of coffee&hellip;</p>
	<p>The minute the water hits the coffee and the aroma starts to drift around the room, the mood begins to lighten&hellip; and the whole situation takes on a much more normal tone.</p>
	<p><strong><em>That, fellow patriots, is the power of Survival Coffee.</em></strong></p>
	<p>Remember: It&rsquo;s been proven that even the SMELL of fresh coffee can boost spirits and elevate moods.</p>
	<p>I sure wouldn&rsquo;t want to be in that situation and NOT have any coffee&hellip; would you?</p>
	<p>So I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re wondering about right now&hellip;</p>

	<h2 class="darkRed text-center">Alright, Frank… How Much?</h2>
	<img style="margin-top: 5px" class="img-responsive pull-right img-padding-left" src="/media/images/f4p/letter/f4p-coffee600-02.jpg" alt="Coffee bags">
	<p>By now, you can see how valuable coffee can be especially to&hellip;</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Keep a sense of normalcy in a turbulent and uncertain time&hellip;</li>
		<li>Maintain optimum performance and keep mental clarity and focus (even if there&rsquo;s chaos around you!)&hellip;</li>
		<li>And to use as currency and barter for the things you or your family might need, no matter what the future holds.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><em>How much is that peace of mind really worth to you and your family?</em></p>
	<p>But good news: I&rsquo;ve got a great supplier who I can deal with directly to get these kits WAY down in price compared to what you&rsquo;d pay at some retail establishment where their canned coffee will waste away in mere months.</p>
	<p>So, as long as I can keep them in stock (which will be a lot shorter than you might think&hellip;) you can get your hands on the complete <strong>Food4Patriots Survival Coffee Kit for my special price of just $97.00</strong></p>
	<p>That&rsquo;s a full 600 servings, coming to a paltry $.16 per cup.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>And like I said earlier, this isn&rsquo;t some cut rate bargain coffee either&hellip;</p>
	<p>It&rsquo;s 100% pure Colombian coffee, 100% Non-GMO and 100% Arabica&hellip; the best on the planet.</p>
	<p>Now, under normal circumstances I&rsquo;d price that much coffee at about $147, but times are tough, and food prices continue to soar so I&rsquo;m offering this complete package at just $97.00&nbsp;</p>
	<p>A real bargain when you think about it and all the benefits that a great cup of coffee brings ya.</p>
	<p>But let me be real clear, this is a <em>limited time offer</em> and I suspect these kits are going to be gone in a heartbeat.</p>
