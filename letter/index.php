						<p class="section-description">In fact, I have no doubt that FEMA hates this. I don&rsquo;t know how long it will be online, so read it while you can.</p>
						<p class="section-description">I&rsquo;ll explain more in a second and I&rsquo;ll show you some shocking <strong>PROOF</strong>, but the bottom line that you need to understand is that FEMA wants survival food real, real, real bad<strong>. </strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;They Are Literally Hoarding It.&quot; </strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the #1 item on their shopping list and that explains why supplies are so low or completely sold out already at many stores across America. </p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m gonna keep our food out of FEMA&rsquo;s hands. In fact, read this and I&rsquo;ll show you how you can get our highest quality Food4Patriots survival food at &ldquo;fire sale&rdquo; prices… as low as $1.10 per serving… but only if you act fast.</p>
<p>But before I reveal the details on claiming your personal food package there&rsquo;s something I need you to do. </p>
<p>Promise to keep this information to yourself and your close family and friends ONLY. We don&rsquo;t want this forwarded on in a chain letter or announced to big groups.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve only got enough 25-year shelf life food packages for one out of every six thousand people to get their own and are letting in just 2 people for every 100 who see this. </p>
<p>And if word gets out that you talked I reserve the right to let someone else claim <strong>YOUR </strong>package. We&rsquo;ve recorded your computer address so be warned.</p>
<p>I hate to be so tough about this issue, but from what I&rsquo;ve seen America could be on the edge of a powerful disaster.</p>
<p>Look, I could probably make a lot more money by &ldquo;selling out&rdquo; to FEMA or marking up our prices at retail because emergency food is sold out in so many places, but…</p>
<strong>&quot;It’s Critical That I Get Your Survival Meals In Your Hands ASAP</strong>&quot;.<br/><br/>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why: </p>
<p>Just a few days ago, FEMA went directly to my supplier and tried to buy up my ENTIRE stockpile of high-quality survival food. It sounds crazy, but I&rsquo;ll show you the exact letter they sent in a minute. Revealing FEMA&rsquo;s plot could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they&rsquo;re doing. Sounds fair, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to show you undeniable proof that FEMA is on the hunt for as much survival food as they can grab in 24 hours, and I&rsquo;ve got to tell you it&rsquo;s REALLY disturbing. You can imagine they were willing to pay a pretty penny… the kind of money small businesses dream about in an economy like this… money that would probably come with a nice fat government contract.</p>

						<h3 class="color-red">&quot;The Fact Is, FEMA Must Know Something We Don’t.&quot;</h3>
					</div>

					<div class="inner pad-30 no-pad-bot">

						<img src="/letter/images/f4p-l-president1.jpg" class="media right">

						<p>My 1st thought was they must be trying to control the supply. Control the food supply and you control the people. Does that make sense to you? </p>
						<p>But then I dug deeper… and I think the situation is even worse. I think that FEMA knows something we don&rsquo;t and is worried that they see a full-scale disaster about to hit. And I think I&rsquo;ve found the factors that will trigger it.</p>
						<p>Before I talk about those warning signs, you need to see the actual letter FEMA sent my supplier so you can see the proof with your own eyes and make up your own mind. </p>
						<p>It&rsquo;s been all over the internet, Facebook and even some big radio programs like Alex Jones picked up this story.</p>
						<p>It seems like everyone is just plain <strong>shocked</strong> that FEMA would send a letter like this.</p>
						<p>Here&rsquo;s what happened. FEMA wrote to my partner Matt over at the warehouse and wanted to know…</p>
						<p>Well, maybe I should just show you the proof from Matt since he was the one who received the letter. I don&rsquo;t mean to sound paranoid, but FEMA is asking some questions that make me pretty nervous.</p>
						<p>Just look at the letter – the FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security demanded to know:</p>
					  <ul>
						  <li>How much of emergency food we can deliver <strong>immediately.</strong></li>
						  <li>How many food kits we&rsquo;ve got on hand...  (With the government&rsquo;s power to seize supplies in a quote &ldquo;state of emergency&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t think I want to answer this)</li>
						  <li>If we can ship dedicated truckloads <em>(that means a truck heading straight for FEMA with nothing but survival food just for them)</em> by the pallet – and how many pallets we could cram in each truck</li>
						  <li>And the strangest question of all – if we worked like mad men, how much emergency food could we produce in 24 hours... </li>
					  </ul>
					  <div class="center" style="max-width:500px;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;margin-bottom:30px;"><img src="/letter/images/fema-letter-1.jpg"  alt="FEMA letter" style="width:100%;"></div>
					  <p>I gotta tell you – I&rsquo;m real concerned. This letter is proof that FEMA wants our emergency survival food. They don&rsquo;t want anyone to know it, and they want to take immediate delivery. And let&rsquo;s not forget the most important part of this: why the sudden urgency? What do they know that we don&rsquo;t? </p>
					  <p>From the sounds of it, something BIG could be about to happen. And it&rsquo;s no wonder that our food is literally flying off the shelves. Makes sense, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
					  <p>This is truly an urgent situation but don&rsquo;t worry…</p>

						<h3 class="color-blue pad-30-t-b no-pad-top" style="text-align: right;">&quot;You Should Know That FEMA Won’t Get <br>
						1 Single Emergency Food Kit From Us.&quot;</h3>

						<img src="images/samples/section1-block2-img2.png" class="media left">

						<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
						<p>Because we don&rsquo;t believe that these critical emergency food kits should be in the hands of the government, stored in some secret warehouse and with the rest of us left with table scraps in a crisis.</p>
						<p>Because we understand that without this food many patriots will be downright helpless in a crisis.</p>
						<p>Because our goal is to get this life-saving food into the hands of people like you and me as quick as possible. </p>
						<p>Sounds good, right?</p>
						<p>But with FEMA competing for the exact meals you are, there&rsquo;s no time to waste. Here&rsquo;s why: </p>
						<p>Like my buddy Matt told me... Even though WE decided not to sell to FEMA… it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before they find some OTHER company who <em>will</em>. </p>
						<p>And when they do it will almost certainly create a shortage of the raw ingredients that we use… especially because we refuse to replace our high-quality, made-in-America food ingredients with foreign stuff…. raising prices and making some survival food completely unavailable at any price.</p>
<h3 class="color-red pad-30-t-b">&quot;But That’s Not The Only Danger That Could 
  <br>
  Snatch Your Food Stockpile Out Of Your Hands.&quot;</h3>
<p>Heck, we&rsquo;ve had a rush of people taking advantage of this special &ldquo;fire sale&rdquo; offer to grab their food kits to protect their family. </p>
					  <p>Now, to be blunt, this is a 1st come 1st serve opportunity, and because of all the controversy I cannot guarantee supply forever.</p>
						<p>Which means if we run out before you have a chance to claim your kit, I&rsquo;m sorry but you&rsquo;ll just have to wait and hope we can get more in… before something really bad hits.</p><img src="/letter/images/f4p-l-truck.jpg" class="media has-bg right full-right">

						<p>Over the last few weeks, my warehouse has been shipping out more truckloads of food packed to the brim than I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Which is great if you&rsquo;ve already put your order in. </p>
						<p>But the bad news is, if you&rsquo;re just hearing about these food kits for the first time, then you&rsquo;re already behind and need to act fast before they&rsquo;re all gone.</p>
						<p>Fortunately, as soon as FEMA said they wanted to take ALL my food, I put in an extra-large order for more food in anticipation of whatever the government is so urgently preparing for. Our production machines are working around the clock right now to meet the increased demand.</p>
						<p>So depending on how much food you need, you can get my Food4Patriots kits for as low as $1.10 per serving. And we&rsquo;re doing everything we can to accelerate packing and shipping so we can rush your kit to you as soon as you order it.</p>
						<p>I&rsquo;m going to keep going this as long as I can. I hope we can help patriots all across the United States feel protected in case of disaster for years to come.</p>

						</div>

						<div class="inner pad-30">

							<img src="/letter/images/f4p-l-canfood1.jpg" class="media has-bg left full-left" style="margin-bottom:10px;">

							<ul>
							  <li>Matt could run out of the raw ingredients needed to get these kits produced. (I&rsquo;d be shocked if FEMA stopped looking for suppliers just because we turned them down – and there are companies a whole lot bigger than us that can buy up all the ingredients).</li>
							  <li>(and I hope the government NEVER gets to this point), part of me thinks that FEMA might have wanted to know how much food we&rsquo;ve got in stock in case they ever decided to take it.</li>
						  </ul>
							<p>The fact is, they could walk in and seize every single kit of food we&rsquo;ve got in our warehouse at the drop of a hat. All it would take is President Obama declaring a &ldquo;State of Emergency.&rdquo;</p>
							<p>And with the way FEMA wanted to know how many meals we could ship out in 24 hours, it makes me think they know something that we don&rsquo;t.</p>
						  <p>I can&rsquo;t tell the future, but from everything I&rsquo;ve seen the U.S. could be on the brink of a major disaster. </p>
							<p>If I&rsquo;m wrong life will go on as normal, and I&rsquo;ll happily admit that I was off my rocker.</p>
							<p>
							  But if I&rsquo;m <em>right</em> this could force our friends and neighbors into FEMA camps. Good people who just didn&rsquo;t prepare.                        </p>
						  <h3 class="color-red pad-30-t-b">&quot;Communist “Food Brainwashing” Is Infecting America.&quot;</h3>


						<img src="/letter/images/food-stamp-chart.png" class="media has-bg right full-right">

<p>No one wants to say this, but everywhere you look, you can see signs that there are freeloading people embracing the idea of a few hardworking patriots supplying all the food and the labor in this country… and the rest sitting back and getting a handout. </p>
<p>There are more people on welfare than any other time in the history of the United States. Even during the Great Depression just 700,000 people were on the books to get that kind of government help.</p>
<p>Obviously FEMA knows this and feels like it&rsquo;s their job to take care of these people.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, there are just too many people who want to rely on the government for food, water &amp; money. And they&rsquo;re pushing the rest of the United States to the brink of a food crisis.</p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s the thing: these numbers don&rsquo;t tell the whole story. States have figured out that to keep their food stamps numbers low they can switch people to disability. In 1961 the main reason people couldn&rsquo;t work was &ldquo;heart disease&rdquo; or &ldquo;stroke&rdquo;. Today it&rsquo;s &ldquo;back pain&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That means while some people really need disability the &ldquo;freeloading&rdquo; mindset has infected a lot of freeloaders who could actually be working.  </p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all being paid for by the Americans who are working two or three jobs just to make ends meet.</p>
<p>If a disaster hits and FEMA hasn&rsquo;t found someone to get a massive food stockpile from, it could spark a riots and looting just like Katrina.</p>
<p>Or when the government&rsquo;s piggy-bank runs out and the handouts dry up, we could be dealing with a food mob 47 million people strong. That&rsquo;s like being invaded by a country the size of Colombia.</p>
<p>A food mob that size could strip shelves bare across the United States…</p>
<p>And seize control of whole system. The government has built up too many people who are waiting on them for food. They obviously know it or they wouldn&rsquo;t be asking for so many millions of meals.</p>

					<div class="inner medium-size pad-30-t-b no-pad-top">
						<p>Not too long ago, President Obama reinstated a radical executive order called &ldquo;National Defense Resources Preparedness Act&rdquo;.  </p>
						<p>It let&rsquo;s the government seize and &ldquo;redistribute&rdquo; food whenever they declare a &ldquo;state of emergency&rdquo;.</p>
						<p>If you think about the fact the government is banning guns, stockpiling ammo and putting more and more surveillance on the U.S. people, this executive order becomes an obvious power grab… that will set the government up to take your food.</p>
						<p>Honestly, when my supplier Matt got that letter from FEMA, one of the thoughts I had was that they could be scoping him out in case they ever needed to seize his supplies. </p>
						<ul>
						  <li><strong>Terrorist attacks </strong></li>
						  <li><strong>Food poisoning </strong></li>
						  <li><strong>And all out war between North Korea, Iran, Syria or even China</strong></li>

						<img src="/letter/images/f4p-l-mob3.jpg" class="media has-bg right full-right">
						<p>See, most people are going to wait and hope the government can protect them. They&rsquo;re willing to give up all their freedoms and independence for the hope they won&rsquo;t have to provide for their own food needs. </p>
						<p>Now, that may be what millions of Americans choose, but there&rsquo;s another group of people who aren&rsquo;t going to take this lying down. They&rsquo;re preparing for this food crisis and not at all happy that FEMA might do the same thing they did with ammo and buy up all the survival food supplies.</p>
						<p>Are you going to be one of them?</p>
						<p>From what I can see the government knows that if you control food you control the people.  </p>
						<p>After all, there&rsquo;s no way to live without food and water.</p>
						<p>Which is exactly why you need to have your own personal food stockpile.</p>

					<h3 class="color-blue medium-size740 pad-30-t-b" style="text-align: center;">&quot;If You Stockpile The Wrong Foods You Could Be
Setting Your Family Up To Starve…&quot;</h3>

				  <div class="inner pad-30 no-pad-top">
					<img src="/letter/images/f4p-l-family1.jpg" class="media right"><p>It sounds harsh, but the truth is most people are giving themselves a false sense of security. </p>
					<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s by…</p>
					<ul>
					  <li>Buying MREs with a 5 year shelf life (depending on where you buy them from they could be near expired)…</li>
					  <li>Getting gross survival foods that are tough to stomach and so high in salt, MSG and preservatives you could clog your arteries and get yourself sick…</li>
					  <li>Or simply buying the wrong foods and leaving a critical hole in your meal plan which means your family can become malnourished… </li>
					</ul>
					<p>The bottom line is if you make any of the million-and-one mistakes while you&rsquo;re designing your food stockpile, your family won&rsquo;t just pay for it with unhealthy eating…</p>
					<p>It can cripple their hope.</p>
					<p>Imagine thinking you&rsquo;ve got an entire stockpile of food just to find it crawling with maggots, roaches and rats…</p>
					<p>And having to walk up to your spouse and kids and tell them your plan failed.</p>
					<p>A lot of people already doubt folks like us who believe in being prepared. They think having food ready for a disaster is silly or even a little crazy…</p>
					<p>And if you make these food-stockpiling mistakes you&rsquo;ll just prove them right.</p>
					<p>This is just too serious not to do something about it. You&rsquo;ve seen the evidence, and if you&rsquo;re anything like me you&rsquo;re probably racking your mind trying to come up with the best way to make sure your family isn&rsquo;t forced to go hungry when a food crisis hits.</p>
					<img src="/letter/images/f4p-l-mre.jpg" class="media left"><p>Well, I decided to stop worrying.</p>
					<p>I started looking around to figure out what our options are. After all, a garden is great, but we just didn&rsquo;t have time. And if a crisis strikes you need food right then and there… not months after the plants have grown and are ready to eat.</p>
					<p>Stockpiling MREs seemed like a good idea, until I found out how bad those things are for you. Just ask any soldier and they&rsquo;ll tell you they&rsquo;re tough on your body and should ONLY be eaten for a short period of time in combat.</p>
					<p>And waiting for the government to give me and my family a handout in a disaster just wasn&rsquo;t an option.</p>
					<p>The only thing I could find that made much sense was a long-term food stockpile.</p>
					<p>Now cans were too much work. You&rsquo;ve got to rotate them regularly or they go bad. And that means wasting a whole lot of food or having to put in quite a bit of work.</p>
					<p>So when I came across the &ldquo;long term survival food&rdquo; suppliers I thought I&rsquo;d struck gold. The food lasts up to 25 years and would be a quick and easy way to feed my family of four for 90 days – no problem. </p>

						<div class="clear"></div>

					<h3 class="color-red pad-30">&quot;But There’s A Catch…&quot;</h3>

					<div class="inner pad-30 no-pad-top">

						<img src="images/samples/section1-block5-img4.jpg" class="media has-bg right full-right">

						<p>They wanted me to shell out more than $5,000 just to get started! </p>
						<p>Honestly, I couldn&rsquo;t understand <em>why </em>it was so expensive.</p>
						<p>There&rsquo;s just no way most people can afford something like that. And I knew that if I couldn&rsquo;t find a way to get food for myself and my family we&rsquo;d be at the mercy of our neighbors and Uncle Sam.</p>
						<p>So I called up Matt, a fellow small business owner that I&rsquo;m proud to call a friend.</p>
						<p>He let me in on the surprising truth about this so called &ldquo;survival food&rdquo;.</p>
						<p>The long-term food suppliers had consumers by the belt… And were jacking up prices by turning it into a &ldquo;name brand&rdquo; game. Almost all these, quote, &ldquo;unique&rdquo; food supply companies were selling the exact same thing BUT they charge ridiculously high prices for two reasons: </p>
						<ul>
						  <li> They&rsquo;re endorsed by some big name celebrity (who probably was paid a pretty penny to do it).</li>
						  <li> They&rsquo;ve got fancy &ldquo;brand name&rdquo; packaging. (Which means they can charge more for the exact same product – just like in a grocery store or a car dealership).</li>
						</ul>
						<p>See, people are getting conned into paying top dollar by buying name brand. Just like it being more expensive at any other store, it&rsquo;s more expensive here.</p>
						<p>Even before the FEMA letter, Matt and I had decided to do what we had to get this food out to normal people who want old-fashioned American food at reasonable prices.</p>
						<p>We&rsquo;ve put together our own survival food kit containing the &ldquo;cream of the crop&rdquo; food. I wanted the absolute best-tasting meals that provided the most nutrition for breakfast, lunch and dinner…</p>
						<p>And was useful for the long haul. That means they had to be conveniently packed in airtight containers that would be easy to move and store for up to 25 years…</p>
						<p>Once we ran our first test package I knew we had something nobody else did. American made food that I&rsquo;d be happy to feed my own kids.</p>
						<p>The food was delicious, easy to store long term and best of all is packaged right here in the U.S of A.</p>
						<p>Plus it didn&rsquo;t have any of those harmful chemicals or genetically modified ingredients. No MSG and no franken-food.</p>

						  <br>
					  That This Was Too Good To Be True.&quot; </h2>
					</div>
					<div class="inner pad-30 "><p>After putting together my dream package, I had to give myself a reality check. I was ready to be disappointed when I slowly asked… &ldquo;so, um – can we buy this cheap?&rdquo;</p>
					<p>The short answer was...</p>
					<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
					<p>If you want enough of these meals to feed your family for a year or more it could cost as much as a new BMW. </p>
					<p>Here&rsquo;s why… the survival food we make for you don&rsquo;t cut any corners. You&rsquo;ll understand what I mean when you see how your meals are made.</p>
					<img src="/letter/images/f4p-l-food1.jpg" class="media left" style="margin-bottom:10px;">
					<p>First, we take 100% non-GMO fruits and veggies as the starting point. Our food is made in America.</p>
					 <p>Next, we combine these top quality ingredients using prize-winning recipes. Many of the recipes we use have won independent taste tests.</p>
					<p>Finally, we seal up the food in convenient pouches that make it easy for you to prepare. And here is another of the big things my buddy Matt does differently. Some manufacturers freeze-dry their food, which is hideously expensive for you, while other manufacturers use the cheaper &ldquo;rapid dehydration&rdquo; method that sucks all the water out – but also pulls nutrients and flavor with it.</p>
					<p>My meals are made with our unique &ldquo;low heat dehydration&rdquo; method, so the flavor and nutrition stays locked in, and it lasts every bit as long as freeze drying without costing you an arm and a leg. Can you see now why our food has been called a &ldquo;stockpilers dream&rdquo;?</p>
					<p>But there&rsquo;s 1 more critical step before your food is finished:</p>
					<p>It takes a $150,000 machine to package these meals to the highest industry standards. The way it works is the space-age Mylar pouches are blasted clean with CO2 gas, and then the container is packed to the brim with a hefty helping of your delicious food. This gets any left over oxygen out so your food won&rsquo;t spoil and in fact is guaranteed for an amazing 25 years of shelf life. See how much better that is for you and your family?</p>
					<p>Now that you see how the best meals are made, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious why getting a big enough stockpile for most families can cost more than a modern day BMW.</p>
					<p>The fact is, you get what you pay for, and you can&rsquo;t expect this kind of quality to come cheap.</p>
					<p>Now here&rsquo;s the problem: if you&rsquo;re like most people, you don&rsquo;t have that kind of cash lying around.</p>
					<p>BUT, Matt and I found a way to make this work.</p>
					<p><strong><em>We buy in bulk.               </em></strong></p>
					<p>Now just to give you some perspective, a bulk order costs tens of thousands of dollars and is <em>a decade</em> of food for my family of 4. My first thought was...</p>
					<p><strong><em>&ldquo;We just don&rsquo;t need that much food.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
					<p>But I figured if I could get this  out to people like you, you&rsquo;d want to grab the same discount I got and would claim your own food package. That way I wouldn&rsquo;t be stuck with a big bill for more food than we can ever eat.</p>
					<p>Everyone who has gotten a Food4Patriots kits has been ecstatic with the long-term packaging, taste and how easy it is to store.</p>
					<p>And now that FEMA has come knocking it&rsquo;s given me a BIG reason to ship as many of these life-saving meals out to people like you and me.  </p></div>

				  <h3 class="color-red pad-30">&quot;Just To Remind You, It’s A 100% First-Come, First-Serve Basis.&quot;</h3>

					<div class="inner pad-30 no-pad-top">
					  <img src="images/f4p-food-packets-08b1.jpg" class="media right" style="margin-bottom:10px;"><p>We&rsquo;re going to offer this &ldquo;fire sale&rdquo; bulk pricing as long as we can, but due to the run on survival food across the country, I cannot guarantee supply beyond the next 24 hours. </p>
					<p>So if you leave this page, you could lose your spot in the line and you risk not being able to get your package because it may be snatched up by someone else… sorry.</p>
					<p>Look, I&rsquo;d rather you get your own personal food stockpile than see DHS hoard them.</p>
					<p>Since these are clearing out FAST I&rsquo;ll be ordering as many as I can. But if this new FEMA demand drains up all the raw ingredients, there may be no way of restocking for a long while. </p>
					<p>But here&rsquo;s the bright side… if it turns out you&rsquo;re too late or your package was already picked up by someone else, it might be for the best.</p>
					<p>After all, this isn&rsquo;t some flashy &ldquo;name brand&rdquo; product. This is survival food FOR patriots, made BY patriots. </p>
					<p>In fact, we&rsquo;ve cut out all the extra packaging you normally pay extra for and instead are using high-efficiency Mylar (the same stuff NASA uses on space suits) to keep your food perfect for the next 25 years. It helps us save money and get these meals to you faster, but it means there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;pretty packaging&rdquo; or &ldquo;celebrity endorsement&rdquo;. They&rsquo;re just sealed up solid to keep for the next 25 years and be as nutritious as the day you got &lsquo;em. Sounds good, right?</p>

					<p>But before you decide whether or not you&rsquo;re going to claim your package, let me explain what you&rsquo;re getting in your Food4Patriots kit: </p>
					<ul>
					  <li class="ulchecked"><strong>First is delicious food that you can prepare in 3 simple steps…</strong><br>
						You don&rsquo;t want to have to worry about cooking complex recipes when you&rsquo;re stuck in a disaster. You can make these meals in less than 20 minutes with no hassle; just add boiling water, simmer, and serve. Can you picture how easy this is?<br>
						<br>
						It&rsquo;s so simple even kids can make them! And don&rsquo;t worry – you&rsquo;ll get a whole slew of choices for breakfast, lunch and dinner so you don&rsquo;t get stuck eating the same thing day-in and day-out.<br>
					  </li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
					  <li class="ulchecked"><strong>Second, you get my guaranteed &ldquo;Disaster-proof&rdquo; Packaging <br>
						</strong>I may not have used &ldquo;showy&rdquo; packaging for expensive branding, but I did make sure it&rsquo;s military-grade sturdy-stuff and can stand up to the crazy things that happen in a crisis.  <br>
						<br>
						This food has a shelf life of up to 25 years, so you have complete peace of mind for the long term. I&rsquo;ve used Mylar pouches – the same material used in NASA&rsquo;s space suits.<br>
						<br>
						This means you&rsquo;ll keep all the air, moisture and light out of the package. It&rsquo;ll also keep the food nutritionally sound and tasting great. So when you need your food stockpile it&rsquo;ll be guaranteed to be as fresh as the day you bought it. Can you see how valuable this will be for you?<br>
					  </li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
					  <li class="ulchecked"><strong>Third, you get foods jam-packed with nutritional value<br>
						</strong>Since I had a chance to go direct to the supplier to build this kit, I was able to throw out all the filler and poor-quality ingredients other guys stuff into their meals. All the food you&rsquo;ll receive is at the tip-top of the long-term food reserve industry. <br>
						<br>
						But here&rsquo;s the other important part. You don&rsquo;t have to settle for smaller serving sizes for kids.  Some people use &ldquo;kids&rsquo; meals&rdquo; to skimp on the amount of food they give you. In Food4Patriots kids get a full adult-sized portion without getting charged extra.<br>
					  </li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
					  <li class="ulchecked"><strong>And Fourth, You Get An Easy-To-Store Package That Takes Up Minimal Space<br>
						</strong>
						<p>Nobody wants to cram their house full of clunky food packages. So many food storage containers are ultra-bulky and come in a slew of awkward shapes and sizes, which makes it difficult to discreetly store food reserves in the average American home. I&rsquo;ve selected the most compact kits I could find so you can store them without any extra hassle. They&rsquo;re sturdy, waterproof and stack easily. </p>
					  </li>
					</ul>
					<p>Since we both know a major food emergency could strike any time, these critical characteristics will give you instant peace of mind when your food package arrives. No more worrying about what you&rsquo;d have to do, or having to rely on the government. Heck, you&rsquo;ll have the exact same stuff they wanted to buy!</p>
					<p>But the big question most people have is &ldquo;What kind of food will I get to eat?!?&rdquo;  Since nobody likes eating the same thing over and over, I&rsquo;ve picked some of my favorites to give you variety.</p>
					<div style="margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;margin-bottom:10px;max-width:500px;"><img src="/letter/images/f4p-l-food2.jpg"  alt="Food Packets"></div>
					<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of a few of the choices:</p>
					<ul>
					  <li>Mountain Man Granola</li>
					  <li>Apple Orchard Oatmeal</li>
					  <li>Granny&rsquo;s Home-style Potato Soup</li>
					  <li>Blue Ribbon Cheesy Chicken Rice (my kids actually beg me to make this one all the time!)</li>
					  <li>Ol&rsquo; 49ers Hearty Chili </li>
					  <li>Creamy Beef Stroganoff</li>
					  <li>Frank&rsquo;s Five Star Minestrone (can you tell this is my favorite?)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>But I&rsquo;ve got a confession to make about this delicious food…  It won&rsquo;t always be this cheap.  In fact, imagine what will happen when you see the headlines: </p>
<p></p>

				<div class="block bg-white">
					<h3 class="color-blue pad-30" style="text-align: center;">“Food Prices Skyrocketing.  Grain Shortage
					  <br>
				  Forces Farms To Close And Cows Starve”</h3>

					<div class="inner pad-30 no-pad-top">
					  <img src="/letter/images/f4p-l-house.jpg" class="media has-bg right full-right">
					  <p>Since the Food4Patriots package is made from honest-to-goodness ingredients produced by farmers here in the US of A, when a crisis hits it&rsquo;ll automatically skyrocket the prices of this kit.</p>
					<p>Farms will shut down and their livestock will go hungry.</p>
					<p>Grain shortages will drive bread to $10, $25, even $100 per loaf. Heck in Germany after World War One, a loaf of bread cost 3 BILLION marks…</p>
					<p>And stores will be hit by angry urban mobs. Just think, people stampede for toys on sale at Wal-Mart. When they and their children are starving because they didn&rsquo;t prepare… <strong>mobs are almost certain. </strong>Are you following this?</p>
					<p>Now the last thing I want happening is someone to give up their chance to claim their Food4Patriots package because they couldn&rsquo;t afford it.</p>

				For Well-Off Americans&quot; </h3>

					<div class="inner medium-size800 pad-30 no-pad-top">
					<p>I know most people couldn&rsquo;t afford to spend $5,000, $10,000 or even $30,000 on a stockpile. </p>
					<p>Which is why the biggest question a lot of people probably have right now is… &ldquo;how much does it cost?&rdquo;</p>
					<p>Honestly, this was a big issue for me and might be a deal-breaker for you. I feel like you can&rsquo;t put a price on food independence and the peace of mind that it gives.</p>
					<p>Now I know every family is different. There&rsquo;s no &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; survival food solution.</p>
					<p>So I&rsquo;ve put together different Food4Patriots kits based on servings to feed one adult, and you can customize your kit to keep your family healthy and happy. </p>
					<p>And unlike most of the suppliers out there, I don’t think you should have to break the bank to afford the most basic level of food security.</p>
					<p>No need to worry about stretching portions to feed a larger family or being forced to order more than you really need - I wanted to make sure I provided different options that would be a perfect fit for YOU.</p>
