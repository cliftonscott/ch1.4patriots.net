						<p><strong class="titles3">Free Bonus #2 - The Water Survival Guide:</strong> Look, without clean water you can't prepare a scrap of food. You've got to have this to complete your stockpile. Not to mention the fact dehydration can hit in as little as 7 hours and turn a full-grown man into a whimpering child. This down-and-dirty guide will show you desperate-times only water sources to keep your family from going thirsty.

In this guide you get the lowdown on outdoor gardens, indoor gardens, freezing, and long-term storage. This is like "food insurance" so your family can eat fresh-picked produce or delicious home-canned delicacies even in a disaster.</p>

			<p>It may sound crazy to offer this double guarantee, but to be honest I'm not really worried about it.</p>
			<p><strong>Here's why:</strong> I'm so confident you're going to see the value in your Food4Patriots kit as soon as you have it in your hands. You'll want to keep it and enjoy every bite of the delicious food.</p>
			<p>But whether you choose to start dipping into your Food4Patriots stockpile right away to stretch your food dollars, or you decide to keep it under lock and key so you're ready for any kind of crisis, you need to know one thing...</p>
			<p>By claiming your Food4Patriots Kit you made the decision not just to get food to feed your family in a disaster, you've made the decision to get peace of mind.</p>
			<p>Food4Patriots customer Jan was thrilled with the shelf life, and the discreet, compact packaging too. Here’s exactly what she said:</p>

			<p>Can you picture how good it's going to feel to have this security and independence? Heck, if you've got an elderly friend or family member nearby you can get a kit for them so you don't have to worry if they're eating or not in a disaster.</p>
			<p>Now a last reminder, don't worry, there's no pressure to claim your Food4Patriots kit. In fact, if you don't want it, you can step aside. No hard feelings.</p>
			<p>There are plenty of other people who are dead set on preparing right now and they see that with all the uncertainty and warning signs we’re seeing on a daily basis, time is running out.</p>
			<h3 class="color-red pad-30-b" style="text-align: center;">&quot;Look, You Have Come To A Fork In The Road And It’s<br class="hidden-sm hidden-xs"> Entirely Up To You Which Way You Go&quot; </h3>
			<p>But if you're serious about your family's stockpile and want to get real food independence and security, <strong>click on the blue “Claim Your Kit” button</strong> you see at the bottom of this page.</p>
			<p>You'll be glad you did.</p>
			<p>This is about peace of mind, knowing that you and your family are well protected in the case of food shortages and natural disasters. Sounds good, right? </p>
			<p>Click on the button below and get your Food4Patriots stockpile rushed to you before they're all gone, and then rest assured knowing that you will be able to feed your family well into the future no matter what happens.</p>

			<h3 class="color-red pad-30-b" style="text-align: center;">&quot;One Final Warning Before It’s Too Late...&quot;</h3>
			<p>If you decide to claim your package, there is something you should know about.</p>
			<p><strong>It's a danger I call 25-year stockpile greed.</strong></p>
			<p>When a food crisis strikes there are really two groups of people: the people who prepared, and the people who didn't.</p>
			<p>If you've read this far my guess is you're someone who's going to prepare. But let me warn you - the rest of the world may very well be greedy for your stockpile.</p>
			<p>Especially now that we know that FEMA wants to hoard these meals too.</p>
			<p><i>It's easy to imagine.</i></p>
			<p>If they run out of food for their children, they'll be willing to take anyone's food to get them fed. And unless you have a covert stockpile, your name could very well make it on that list.</p>
			<p>To keep your Food4Patriots order under the radar, we ship it in normal unmarked packaging. There're no flashy logos, advertisements or emblems on the outside. Not even the postman will know what you're getting.</p>
			<p><strong>Click the “Claim Your Kit” button down below to get started.</strong> Don't leave empty handed! You can get a kit with three square meals a day for as little as $1.11 per serving. Are you ready to get started?</p>
			<p>Claim your Food4Patriots package now. Click the big blue “Claim Your Kit” button below.</p>

				<p>It's 9:07 AM and the "you know what" has just hit the fan. People are panicking. It's all over the radio and TV.</p>
				<p>A news anchor comes on the TV screen and in a shaky voice says, "We are in a state of emergency. I repeat, we are now in a state of emergency."</p>
				<p>The 47 million freeloaders spoon-fed by "big government" are marching in the streets. There are rumors of looting. In fact there's a mob at your local grocery store. Like a swarm of locusts, the mob completely cleans out the grocery store in less than two hours, leaving the shelves completely bare.</p>
				<p>Panic is spreading and it's quickly becoming every man for himself.</p>
				<p>You're safe at home with your family, thank goodness. But now your family is looking at you. "What's going to happen?" they ask. And then your spouse pulls you close and whispers in your ear, "What are we going to eat?"</p>
