	<p><strong>Chances are you&rsquo;ve got a great start on your survival food stockpile… </strong></p>
	<p><strong>But do you have protein to &ldquo;survive and thrive&rdquo;?</strong></p>
	<p>In a crisis, your body is under extreme stress.  You need all your strength and then some to cope with all the chaos going on around you, and to keep your loved ones safe. To do that, you&rsquo;ve got to get enough high-quality protein.</p>
	<p>In fact, protein isn&rsquo;t just a nutritional staple of a good diet; it&rsquo;s a critical component to staying healthy...<strong>especially when the crap hits the fan!</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
	<p>Well, for starters, unless you&rsquo;re getting enough, your body will turn to the only other source of protein that&rsquo;s available – by consuming its own muscle tissue.</p>
	<p><strong>Without enough quality protein, your body literally STARTS EATING ITSELF.</strong></p>
	<p>Gross, right? </p>
	<p>Maybe, but 100% true.</p>
	<p>Even the USDA recognizes the body&rsquo;s need for protein. Their current guidelines recommend a daily <strong>MINIMUM</strong> intake of 50 grams of high-quality protein for the average adult. In a disaster situation, it&rsquo;ll be even higher because you burn more calories than normal.</p>

	<h2 class="darkRed text-center">Lean Protein Is The Cornerstone <br class="hidden-xs">Of Good Health</h2>
	<p>Protein is literally the “building block” of healthy cells – it helps your body make muscles, regenerate organs, and grow hair. There isn’t a system in your body that doesn’t need lean, high-quality protein to thrive – even more so when you’re facing a crisis.</p>

	<h2 class="darkRed text-center">What Are Some Other Crucial <br class="hidden-xs">Benefits of Protein?</h2>
	<ul class="fa-ul">
		<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-circle"></i><strong>Keeps hunger at bay.</strong> Protein takes longer to digest, and keeps you feeling fuller, longer.</li>
		<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-circle"></i><strong>Preserves muscle.</strong> Think of protein as the &ldquo;bricklayer&rdquo; of your body. Protein is crucial to building strong muscles, and keeps the body from losing muscle tissue when it&rsquo;s not getting enough.</li>
		<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-circle"></i><strong>Strengthens bones. </strong>Quality protein keeps our bones dense and helps prevent diseases like osteoporosis, which can lead to fractures.<strong></strong></li>
		<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-circle"></i><strong>Mental sharpness. </strong>In a crisis, you&rsquo;ve got to be alert and focused. Protein helps your brain function at peak levels.</li>
		<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-circle"></i><strong>Better sleep. </strong>Adequate protein keeps you active during the day and helps you get a peaceful night&rsquo;s rest.<strong></strong></li>
	</ul>

	<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that a high-quality source of digestible protein should be a critical part of your overall survival food plan. And that doesn&rsquo;t mean buying up loads of fattening, sugary peanut butter or tasteless cans of tuna…all of which can go bad in just a couple of years.</p>
	<p>Nope – I&rsquo;ve got a better solution…one that&rsquo;s proven to stay fresh for a staggering 25 years!</p>

	<h2 class="darkRed text-center">In fact, my new “Meat & Protein Kit” was the #1 requested item from Food4Patriots customers…a real “protein boost” to round out and “supercharge” their survival food stockpiles was just the ticket.</h2>
	<p>And, truth be told, I didn&rsquo;t want to offer anything less than the very best…no cutting corners or using cheap fillers. No sir.</p>
	<p>I searched for the best quality meat &amp; protein options available. Most didn&rsquo;t pass muster for quality, taste, or long shelf life. </p>
	<p>After much trial and error, I finally found the exact high-quality protein kit my customers have been clamoring for – one that&rsquo;s delicious, nutritious, and rated good for 25 years! </p>
	<p>Now just so you know…I&rsquo;m more than a perfectionist when it comes to any of my Food4Patriots products. It&rsquo;s no different with my Meat &amp; Protein Kit…</p>
	<p>That&rsquo;s why this painstaking process took so long. I was going to &ldquo;do it right&rdquo; or not at all…</p>
	<p>From the advanced dehydration process and space-age Mylar packaging that seals in nutrients and flavor, to <strong>using a separate FDA approved facility to make them</strong>, I refused to cut corners in any way. It costs me more, but nothing is too good for my customers.</p>

	<h2 class="darkRed text-center">Now, You Can “Fill In The Gaps” Of Your Survival Food Stockpile With Our First Ever Food4Patriots Meat And Protein Kit!</h2>
