	<p>Dear Patriot,</p>
	<p><strong>Fruits and veggies are vital to your overall survival food plan.</strong></p>
	<p>There’s no doubt – in order to get and stay healthy, you’ve got to get multiple servings of fruit and vegetables each day.</p>
	<p><strong>You’ll especially need them when facing a crisis, when these foods are hard, if not impossible to come by…</strong></p>
	<p>There’s no other food group that’s as life giving as these orchard and garden delights…chocked full of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber.</p>
	<p>Even if you’re more of a “meat and potatoes” kind of person, most everyone enjoys a bowl of sweet, juicy strawberries or garden fresh veggies like broccoli and green beans.</p>
	<p>Truth is, without an adequate intake of fruits and veggies, your body simply isn’t getting the nutrients it needs to work right.</p>
	<p>And folks, despite what others may claim, <strong>there’s no pill you can pop that will replace them.</strong></p>
	<p>Let me explain…</p>
	<p>Plant-based foods are naturally low in calories but high in nutrition. There’s no other food group (what scientists with fancy degrees call macronutrients) that can protect your body’s cells and keeps things “humming along” better.</p>

	<h2 class="darkRed text-center">Eating Fruits and Vegetables Can Help Maximize the Nutrition of Your Survival Food!</h2>
	<img class="img-responsive pull-right img-padding-left" src="/media/images/f4p/letter/f4p-letter-fvs-basket.jpg" alt="Food4Patriots 1 Year Kit">
	<p>When you add high-quality fruits and vegetables to your existing survival food stockpile, you’ll enjoy knowing you’re optimizing the level of nutrients your body needs</p>
	<p>What Are Some Other Crucial Benefits of fruits and vegetables?</p>
	<ul class="fa-ul fa-ul-space">
		<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i><strong>Better regularity.</strong> Fiber keeps your digestive tract healthy and helps move waste out of your system, which helps you feel your best and be “light on your feet” – which is critical when you need to move fast.</li>
		<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i><strong>Faster healing and boosted immunity</strong> Our bodies don’t make all the vitamins we need, so we need to eat foods that are rich in them to recover faster from infections and illness, which helps if you’re injured or catch a nasty bug.</li>
		<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i><strong>Clear thinking</strong> Whole plant foods contain the nutrients that keep your brain sharp as a tack – especially important in a survival situation.</li>
		<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i><strong>Natural anti-inflammatory.</strong> Antioxidants in fruit and veggies help protect your ticker and other vital organs by scavenging for free radicals that cause sickness.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Okay…so there’s no arguing that you’ve got to have an adequate amount of fruits and vegetables ever day for <strong>better</strong> health…but how do you work them into your survival food plan? </p>
	<p>I mean…fresh fruits and veggies spoil after just a few days, right?</p>
	<p>How are you supposed to survive on rotting produce?</p>
	<p>Well, you’re not.</p>
