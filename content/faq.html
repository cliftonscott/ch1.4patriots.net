<div class="question"><p>Q: Can I order the Food4Patriots kits if I live outside the USA?</p></div>

<div class="question"><p>Q: Is it safe to buy online?</p></div>

<div class="answer"><p>A: Buying online is absolutely one of the safest ways to shop! SSL Certificates authenticate our identity, and encrypt the information visitors enter on our site. This keeps thieves from &quot;overhearing&quot; any exchange between our Web page and another computer. When an SSL Certificate is installed, you can rest assured that the information you send is secured and can't be viewed by cyber crooks.</p>
	
<p>Our SSL certificate enables the browser and Web server to build a secure, encrypted connection. The SSL &quot;handshake&quot; process, which establishes the secure session, takes place discreetly behind the scenes without interrupting your shopping experience. A padlock icon in the browser's status bar and the &quot;https://&quot; prefix in the URL are the only visible indications of a secure session in progress.</p>

<p>The Food4Patriots checkout page is secured with a Symantec Class 3 EV SSL Web Server Certificate. Transactions on the site are protected with up to 256-bit Secure Sockets Layer encryption. Encryption means that all data transmitted is scrambled so even if something went awry, it would be meaningless to any unintended receiver.</p>

<p>We use a third-party credit card processor that meets the strictest international standards for data security to manage our credit card payments, so no one ever has access to your credit card information. We do NOT keep your credit card number on file.</p></div>

<div class="question"><p>Q: How do I open and view the bonus manuals?</p></div>

<div class="answer"><p>A: Once you've downloaded the manuals to your computer, you'll need Adobe Acrobat Reader to view them. Don't worry, Adobe Acrobat Reader costs nothing and it's already installed on most computers. If you don't have it or for some reason your book still won't open, please visit&nbsp;www.Adobe.com&nbsp;to download the newest version and install it. You'll need a video player like Quicktime (available&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/" target="_blank">here for free</a>) to watch the videos. If you still have problems, please contact our customer service representative at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:help@food4patriots.com">help@food4patriots.com</a>.</p></div>

<div class="question"><p>Q. Where is your food made?</p></div>

<div class="answer"><p>A. Our food is made in an FDA approved and inspected facility right here in the United States. We source US-grown ingredients and the entire food production process happens right here in the good ole US of A!</p></div>



<div class="question"><p>Q. Some of your food contains Autolyzed Yeast Extract. I’ve heard this is the same as MSG.</p></div>

<div class="answer"><p>A. Autolyzed yeast consists of concentrations of yeast cells that have been allowed to break up so that the yeasts’ own digestive enzymes break down their proteins into simpler compounds, essentially turning the yeast into a pre-digested protein. When added to food, it is considered a nutritional supplement. While it is technically possible to chemically create MSG from the various components of autolyzed yeast, this is not a normal procedure because there are much easier and simpler ways of creating MSG for commercial use. None of our food has been exposed to radiation or contains any added MSG, hydrogenated oils, trans fats, or ingredients that have been genetically modified. While salt (sodium) is a natural preservative and is found in ALL survival food on the market, we pride ourselves on having some of the lowest sodium levels in the industry. </p></div>

<div class="question"><p>Q. Where can I find the ingredients/nutritional information for each food?</p></div>

<div class="answer"><p>A. We are pleased to provide you with a full list of each and every ingredient used to make our foods. We have even included the full nutritional information as well. Download the full list <a href="http://food4patriots.com/info/docs/Food4Patriots-Ingredients.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>



<div class="question"><p>Q. What is the shelf life of Food4Patriots?</p></div>

<div class="answer"><p>A. Dehydrated food, stored properly (airtight and at room temperature or below) never really expires, but after 25 years the nutritional value will slowly start to decline. For that reason we guarantee a 25 year shelf life.</p> </div>


<div class="question"><p>Q. What is the calorie count per day?</p></div>

<div class="answer"><p>A. Our kits are based around servings. Instead of laying out meal plans for people we allow you to consume as much or as little of the product on a daily basis that meets their individual needs. The time frames (72 hours, 4 weeks, 3 months) is just a standard guideline and the food may last you a longer or shorter period of time depending upon their consumption and what other foods you may be supplementing into your daily diet from the regular pantry.</p>
<p>Because our food doesn't contain unnecessary fillers or high sugar contents, the calorie counts are inherently less than you will find in most store-bought food. The difference is that you are enjoying wholesome ingredients that your body recognizes and processes as &ldquo;real food.&rdquo;</p>	
</div>


<div class="question"><p>Q: What is your return policy and instructions?</p></div>
<div class="answer"><p>A: If for any reason you're dissatisfied at any time during the first 60 days after purchase, simply return the product and ask for a full refund. You'll get your money back. That's a firm promise and commitment. Please see<a href="returns.php"> this page </a>for full return instructions.</p></div>

<div class="question"><p>Q: How large are these kits and will I have enough room to store them?</p></div>

<div class="answer"><p>A:  Absolutely!  Your 4 week kit comes in a tote which measures 18" long x 12.63" wide x 7.13" high. Your 3 month kit comes in two totes that are each: 25.75" long x 18.37" wide x 7.13" high. All totes are designed to be able to stack nicely and can be stored in your basement, garage, or conveniently in a kitchen cabinet.  Totes are waterproof, sturdy, and the perfect solution for long term storage. </p>
