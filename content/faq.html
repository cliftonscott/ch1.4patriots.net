<div class="question"><p>Q: Is it safe to buy online?</p></div>
<div class="answer"><p>A: Buying online is absolutely one of the safest ways to shop! SSL Certificates authenticate our identity, and encrypt the information visitors enter on our site. This keeps thieves from "overhearing" any exchange between our Web page and another computer. When an SSL Certificate is installed, you can rest assured that the information you send is secured and can't be viewed by cyber crooks.</p>

<p>Our SSL certificate enables the browser and Web server to build a secure, encrypted connection. The SSL "handshake" process, which establishes the secure session, takes place discreetly behind the scenes without interrupting your shopping experience. A padlock icon in the browser's status bar and the "https://" prefix in the URL are the only visible indications of a secure session in progress.</p>

<p>The Patriot Power Generator checkout page is secured with a GoDaddy.com Web Server Certificate. Transactions on the site are protected with up to 256-bit Secure Sockets Layer encryption. Encryption means that all data transmitted is scrambled so even if something went awry, it would be meaningless to any unintended receiver.</p>

<p>We use a third-party credit card processor that meets the strictest international standards for data security to manage our credit card payments, so no one ever has access to your credit card information. We do NOT keep your credit card number on file.</p></div>

<div class="question"><p>Q: What is your return policy and instructions?</p></div>

<div class="answer"><p>A: If, in the first 365 days after purchase the customer is not 100% satisfied with their generator, they may return it. To obtain a refund the customer first needs to contact our customer service department at 800-680-8504. The customer service representative will arrange for a pick-up of the generator via UPS. 
 
</p>
  <p>We will accept returns of generators accompanied by the extension cord and foldable solar panel only if they are in good merchantable condition (I.e. we could resell them because they’re in good shape). Returned generators are NOT subject to a re-stocking fee.</p>
 
<p>The Patriot Power Generator also comes with a 365-day warranty. This warranty covers any defects in materials or workmanship and non-cosmetic normal wear and tear related damages. These returns will be repaired or replaced with a certified reconditioned unit that will continue under the original warranty terms and expiration date.</p>
 
<p>The warranty does not cover damage or defect caused willfully or through negligence. It doesn’t cover damage due to excessive wear and tear, or cosmetic blemishes, scratches or dents through the course of regular use. The warranty additionally doesn’t cover damage caused by use of the unit with unsafe, unregulated or inappropriate devices or from use of the product for anything other than what it was intended.</p>
