	<div class="header">Returns &amp; Refunds Policy
		</div>
	<p>We hope that you'll absolutely love our products.</p>
	
	<p>You are fully protected by a 100% money-back return policy.</p>
	
	<p>Here's how it works...</p>
	
	<p>If for any reason you're dissatisfied at any time during the first 60 days after purchase, simply return the product and ask for a full refund. You'll get your money back. That's a firm promise and commitment.</p>
		
	<p>In order to obtain a full refund under this policy,  products should be shipped at your expense to the address listed below, must include your purchase information (such as a copy of the order confirmation we emailed you or at the very least the email address you used when you ordered) so that we can send you the refund, and the products should be in merchantable condition (i.e. we could resell them because they're in good condition). Returned  products are NOT subject to a re-stocking fee.
</p>

	<p>Send your product return by mail to:</p>
		<p><strong>Food4Patriots<br />
        Attn: Returns Department<br />
        1920 South 5200 West<br />
        Salt Lake City, UT 84104</strong></p>
        
	<p>If you have any questions about your return, please e-mail your question to <script type="text/javascript">
		  emailE=('help@' + 'food4patriots.com')	
		  document.write(
			'<A href="mailto:' + emailE + '">' 
			+ emailE + '</a>'
		  )
		</script>. Please include the words “Return Question” in the subject line of your e-mail so that we can address your question quickly.</p>
	
	<p>Finally, and this is totally optional and at your discretion, we sure would appreciate it if you would include some explanation for why you’re returning the product so we can work to make the product better. We want satisfied customers and we appreciate &amp; welcome your feedback.</p>
