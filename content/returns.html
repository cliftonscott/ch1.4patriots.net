	<div class="header">Returns &amp; Refunds Policy
		</div>
	<p>We hope that you'll absolutely love our products.</p>
	
	<p>You are fully protected by a 100% money-back return policy.</p>
	
	<p>Here's how it works...</p>
	
	<p>If for any reason you're dissatisfied at any time during the first 365 days after purchase, simply contact us to return the product and ask for a full refund. You'll get your money back. That's a firm promise and commitment.</p>
		
	<p>In order to obtain a full refund under this policy, physical products must be returned to our warehouse, include your purchase information (such as a copy of the order confirmation we emailed you or at the very least the email address you used when you ordered) so that we can send you the refund, and the products should be in merchantable condition (i.e. we could resell them because they're in good condition). Returned physical products are NOT subject to a re-stocking fee.
</p>

	<p>Due to government regulations regarding the shipping of Lithium Ion batteries, our customer support team will be happy to assist in this process.  <strong>Please contact our team by phone at 800-680-8504 to begin the return process.</strong> 
</p>
	<p>If you have any questions about your return, please e-mail your question to help@patriotpowergenerator.com. Please
		include the words “Return Question” in the subject line of your e-mail so that we can address your question 
		quickly.</p>
	
	<p>Finally, and this is totally optional and at your discretion, we sure would appreciate it if you would include 
		some explanation for why you’re returning the product so we can work to make the product better. We want 
		satisfied customers and we appreciate &amp; welcome your feedback.</p>
