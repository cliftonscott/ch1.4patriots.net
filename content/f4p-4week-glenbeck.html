		Right Now...</h2>

	<p><span class="numberCircle"><strong>1</strong></span><strong> You Need More Food To Protect You and Your Family </strong></p>

	<p>You need more food to feed your family if a natural disaster like Katrina or Sandy hits... if a terrorist attack prevents trucks
		from hauling food… or if a panicked mob loots the grocery stores throughout. By stocking up on non-perishable food now, not only you will
		have your own “food insurance policy” no matter what happens, you’ll have enough to share with friends and loved ones so they can experience
		the same peace of mind.</p>

	<p><span class="numberCircle"><strong>2</strong></span><strong> You Can Barter Your Food In Times Of Crisis</strong></p>

	<p>In a time of crisis, your food will be literally more valuable than gold and you will be able to barter your extra food for whatever
		you need. When the crisis hits, stores will shut down, farmers won’t be able to feed their livestock, urban mobs will riot. Food will be
		incredibly valuable. Look at what happened in Germany after World War I, when a pound of bread cost 3 BILLION marks!</p>

	<p><span class="numberCircle"><strong>3</strong></span><strong>You Save $50.00 (That&rsquo;s 25% Off!) &amp; Get FREE Shipping </strong></p>

	<p>You will get a great deal if you act now! This special sale offer is only for customers who have already purchased our Food4Patriots basic survival kit. It&rsquo;s a 1-time discount sale price of $147 – that&rsquo;s a <strong>massive $50.00 discount and 25% off the already-low price</strong> – but only if you act now.</p>

	<p><span class="numberCircle"><strong>4</strong></span><strong> Glenn Beck Endorses This Survival Food & 4-Week Kits Are Flying Off The Shelves!</strong></p>

	<p>Glenn Beck, the well-known talk-show host and outspoken radio personality, has endorsed Patriot Pantry, the meals in all Food4Patriots
		kits as THE emergency food kits he recommends for his OWN family. While we’re grateful for Glenn’s support, the phone has been ringing
		off the hook and we’ve barely been able to keep up with the demand his endorsement has generated. We can’t guarantee we’ll still have
		4-week emergency food kits available so get yours TODAY while we still have them in stock!</p>

				<p>Dear Friends,</p>
				<p>How long would you last if the grocery stores ceased to exist? </p>
				<p>I know this sounds like a crazy question but it&rsquo;s actually not. </p>
				<p>After Hurricane Sandy hit, grocery stores were closed, 1000s of people were without access to food and help from the government was painfully slow as it always is. </p>
				<p>Don&rsquo;t let it happen to you. You never know what tomorrow might bring.</p>
				<p>I&rsquo;d like to advise you to keep emergency food on hand and I recommend Patriot Pantry emergency survival food. That&rsquo;s what I have in my home to protect my family. </p>
				<p>These meals are delicious, nutritious, and rated for 25 years of storage so they&rsquo;re perfect to stash in your pantry, car, or even office. Today I would like you to try some for yourself. Do your own homework. Try it. Taste it. </p>
				<p>- Glenn Beck</p>
