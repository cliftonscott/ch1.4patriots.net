  		<strong>Twenty-five year life span! Wow!</strong></div>
		I was always stockpiling food for emergencies, and other items as well as food…I have thrown away so much
        food, just because it's expired and I haven't been able to get to it.  When this came along I thought,
        twenty-five year life span! Wow! … They keep in touch with you.  You get your emails, you get your confirmations,
        and then you can track your shipment.  It just came so quick.  It came right when they said it would come. - <strong>Wanda</strong></div>

  		The life expectancy of your product is what attracted me. Now that my first order has arrived, I like the fact that the package, 
  		once I moved the label to the inside of the lid, doesn’t scream “food storage” to unwelcome/prying eyes. I had been concerned about
  		 stocking up with foodstuffs that wouldn’t last more than two to four years. This cuts down on bulk greatly, too.
  		 The only thing that would prevent me from recommending this to a friend would be that I don’t want my ‘friends’ to know I have it! 
  		 My hope is that we never need to worry about surviving through hard times, but it certainly isn’t looking good for the USA or the world right now. <br>-<strong> Jan H.</strong></div>

  	I would like to thank Frank Bates and 4Patriots for reaching out to their fellow Americans with all their survival hints and instructions. My purchase of Food4Patriots has
  	 indeed brought me peace of mind. Anyone has access at this time, to make this purchase even if they are only slightly survival minded. I particularly loved the choices in the
  	  different price and size ranges for the Food4Patriots product. These are the reasons I am so satisfied with my purchase:
        <br>&nbsp;<br>
          <ul>
            <li>It arrived non descriptive, nicely packaged, and in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how protectively packed the products themselves are, and I particularly loved the strong storage bin it is stored in. The fact that it has a shelf life 
            	of 25 years, if it is properly stored, is an added plus! Freeze dried is the way to go!<u></u></li>
            <li>And of course, all the different choices of nourishing, healthy, tasty, and attractive meal choices are reassuring! I intend to make a second purchase in the near future,
            	 as my budget allows because it just makes sense.<u></u></li>
          </ul>
Frank, thank you again for stepping up and sharing your knowledge with people like myself that wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance if not for your courage. Of course this is not for free, but 
it is fairly priced to give anyone an opportunity to achieve a chance for survival that we would not have ordinarily. God bless you! - <strong>  Lynn G.</strong></div>

  	<div class="testimonial-header"><strong>Your supply pack is compact yet FULL…</strong></div>
  	I really like the fact that your supply pack is compact yet FULL. It also is unremarkable in appearance therefore saving me ALL the questions from outsiders so less risk to me and mine…nobody 
  	but us knows what it is…I do feel quite a bit more prepared and confident that WE will be ok for a window of time in a crisis and yes I would recommend this to the select few that I trust and 
  	care about. - <strong> Pam F.</strong></div>

  	<div class="testimonial-header"><strong>I intend to buy more…</strong></div>
  	Frank, I like the 3 month food supply I bought from you and I intend to buy more once funds are available. The long shelf life is worry free and no matter when s**t hits the fan, the food pack 
  	will be ready to serve up. This is much easier than rotating out can food items with shorter shelf life. I have passed on your web site to family members so they can begin to prepare for future events. - <strong> Ralph B.</strong></div>

  	<div class="testimonial-header"><strong>I would recommend this product to family and friends…</strong></div>
  	The reason I purchased your product was the whole food ingredients, and the 25 year shelf life. I will feel more secure when I receive my product. Being prepared is way better than being stuck in a 
  	catastrophe with nothing. I would recommend this product to family and friends, because of the quality, shelf life, and price. - <strong> Stacy C.</strong></div>
